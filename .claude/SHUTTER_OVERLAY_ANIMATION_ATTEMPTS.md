# ShutterOverlay Text Animation - Attempt Log

## User Requirements:
- Text must remain ABOVE the shutters (z-index 100 vs shutters at z-90)
- Text must use clip-path animation (not opacity)
- Text should be clipped as the shutters OPEN
- Text should start from the middle and open up
- Text must be fully visible initially before any scroll

---

## Attempt 1 - Opacity Animation (REJECTED)
**Change:** Used opacity + y movement instead of clip-path
**User Feedback:** "Id like to change back to the clip path for the text over the shutteroverlay animation."
**Outcome:** User explicitly wanted clip-path, not opacity

---

## Attempt 2 - Wrong Timing
**Change:** Used `clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)"` but timing was wrong
**User Feedback:** "the text is not clipped please revise."
**Outcome:** Animation timing didn't match shutter movement

---

## Attempt 3 - Wrong Direction (60%)
**Change:** Adjusted timing to 60%
**User Feedback:** Rejected - wrong direction
**Outcome:** Still not matching the shutter opening motion

---

## Attempt 4 - Text Under Shutters (MAJOR ERROR)
**Change:** Changed z-index to put text UNDER shutters
**User Feedback:** "im getting frustrated. You keep changing my design. the text MUST remain ABOVE the shutters"
**Outcome:** Violated core design requirement - text must be above shutters

---

## Attempt 5 - Clips Only From Top
**Change:** Used `clipPath: "inset(100% 0% 0% 0%)"`
**User Feedback:** User frustrated - this only clips from top, not both directions
**Outcome:** Wrong clip direction

---

## Attempt 6 - Back to Middle Clip
**Change:** Reverted to `clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)"` after user clarified shutters OPEN not close
**User Feedback:** User clarified shutters open, not close
**Outcome:** Still not working correctly

---

## Attempt 7 - Opacity Again (REJECTED)
**Change:** Changed to opacity animation again
**User Feedback:** "oh no, i did not want this! ive already asked you to revert it once"
**Outcome:** User very frustrated - had already rejected opacity approach

---

## Attempt 8 - Revert to Clip Path
**Change:** Reverted back to `clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)"` with initial style
**User Feedback:** Accepted revert
**Outcome:** Back to known state but still not working as desired

---

## Attempt 9 - Expand From Middle (REJECTED)
**Change:**
- Start: `clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)"` (clipped in middle)
- End: `clipPath: "inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)"` (fully visible)
- Used `fromTo` to expand text outward
**User Feedback:** "omg no you did it again revert"
**Outcome:** User immediately rejected - wrong direction again

---

## Attempt 10 - Reverted Again
**Change:** Reverted to:
- Start: `clipPath: "inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)"`
- Animate to: `clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)"`
**User Feedback:** "something is still broken"
**Outcome:** Text not visible above shutters initially

---

## Attempt 11 - Set Initial State
**Change:**
- Added explicit `gsap.set()` to initialize clip-path
- Start: `clipPath: "inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)"` (fully visible)
- Animate to: `clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)"` (clipped to middle)
- Text z-index: 100 (above shutters at z-90)

**Code:**
```typescript
// Set initial clip-path state
gsap.set(textOverlay, {
  clipPath: "inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)",
});

// Animate text with clip-path
gsap.to(textOverlay, {
  clipPath: "inset(50% 0% 50% 0%)",
  ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "body",
    start: "top top",
    end: `+=${maxScroll}`,
    scrub: 1,
    invalidateOnRefresh: true,
  },
});
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Text starts fully visible ABOVE shutters (before scroll)
2. As user scrolls, shutters open (move up/down away from center)
3. Simultaneously, text clips toward the middle
4. Text remains on z-100 layer throughout

**User Feedback:** Still had issues with the animation not working as expected

---

## ✅ Attempt 12 - Polygon Clip-Path (FINAL WORKING SOLUTION)
**Change:**
- Switched from `inset()` clip-path to `polygon()` clip-path
- Used `onUpdate` callback to dynamically calculate polygon points
- Text clips in sync with shutter positions using viewport height units
- Removed `gsap.context()` and `gsap.set()` for simpler approach
- Stored tween references for proper cleanup

**Code:**
```typescript
const ShutterOverlay = ({ children }: ShutterOverlayProps) => {
  const topBarRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const bottomBarRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const textOverlayRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const maxScroll = window.innerHeight * 0.5;

    // Animate top shutter
    const topTrigger = gsap.to(topBarRef.current, {
      yPercent: -100,
      ease: "none",
      scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: "body",
        start: "top top",
        end: `+=${maxScroll}`,
        scrub: true,
      },
    });

    // Animate bottom shutter
    const bottomTrigger = gsap.to(bottomBarRef.current, {
      yPercent: 100,
      ease: "none",
      scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: "body",
        start: "top top",
        end: `+=${maxScroll}`,
        scrub: true,
      },
    });

    // Animate text overlay clip-path
    const textTrigger = gsap.to(textOverlayRef.current, {
      onUpdate: function () {
        const progress = this.progress();
        const topShutterBottom = 50 - progress * 50;
        const bottomShutterTop = 50 + progress * 50;
        const clipPath = `polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% ${topShutterBottom}vh, 0 ${topShutterBottom}vh, 0 ${bottomShutterTop}vh, 100% ${bottomShutterTop}vh, 100% 100%, 0 100%)`;

        if (textOverlayRef.current) {
          textOverlayRef.current.style.clipPath = clipPath;
        }
      },
      ease: "none",
      scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: "body",
        start: "top top",
        end: `+=${maxScroll}`,
        scrub: true,
      },
    });

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      topTrigger.scrollTrigger?.kill();
      bottomTrigger.scrollTrigger?.kill();
      textTrigger.scrollTrigger?.kill();
      topTrigger.kill();
      bottomTrigger.kill();
      textTrigger.kill();
    };
  }, []);

  // ... JSX
}
```

**Key Breakthroughs:**
1. **Polygon clip-path** creates a complex shape that reveals/hides text precisely where shutters are
2. **Dynamic calculation** - Clip-path updates on every animation frame based on scroll progress
3. **Viewport height units (vh)** - Ensures clip-path matches shutter positions exactly
4. **Progress-based math**:
   - Top shutter edge: `50vh - (progress * 50vh)` → starts at 50vh, ends at 0vh
   - Bottom shutter edge: `50vh + (progress * 50vh)` → starts at 50vh, ends at 100vh
5. **Polygon shape** - Creates an "H" shape that reveals text only where shutters aren't covering

**Polygon Explanation:**
```
Initial (progress = 0):
polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 50vh, 0 50vh, 0 50vh, 100% 50vh, 100% 100%, 0 100%)
         └─────────┬─────────┘  └───┬────┘  └───┬────┘  └─────────┬─────────┘
              Top rectangle      Middle gap    Middle gap    Bottom rectangle
                                (height: 0)   (height: 0)

Final (progress = 1):
polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 0vh, 0 0vh, 0 100vh, 100% 100vh, 100% 100%, 0 100%)
         └──────┬──────┘  └──┬───┘  └────┬─────┘  └──────┬──────┘
         Top (collapsed)  Gap    Middle gap (full)    Bottom (collapsed)
```

**Final Behavior:**
1. ✅ Text starts fully visible (shutters cover text edges)
2. ✅ As user scrolls, shutters move away from center
3. ✅ Text is clipped in perfect sync with shutter positions
4. ✅ Text remains on z-100 (above shutters at z-90)
5. ✅ Smooth animation with Lenis smooth scrolling
6. ✅ Proper cleanup of all tweens and ScrollTriggers

**Status:** ✅ Working perfectly! User confirmed fix.

## Key Mistakes Made:
1. Repeatedly changing between opacity and clip-path despite user explicitly requesting clip-path
2. Misunderstanding the direction of the shutter animation (opening vs closing)
3. Changing z-index to put text under shutters, violating core design requirement
4. Not setting initial clip-path state explicitly via gsap.set()
5. Confusing "start from middle and open up" with the animation direction

## Lessons Learned:

### Core Requirements
- User wants clip-path animation ONLY (no opacity)
- Text MUST stay above shutters (z-index 100)
- Shutters OPEN (move away from each other)
- Text should clip in sync with shutter positions

### Key Insights
1. **Polygon > Inset** - Polygon clip-path gives precise control over complex shapes
2. **Dynamic Calculation** - Use `onUpdate` callback for frame-by-frame updates
3. **Viewport Units** - Use `vh` to match shutter positions exactly
4. **Simpler is Better** - Don't need `gsap.context()` for this use case
5. **Store References** - Keep tween references for proper cleanup
6. **Progress-Based Math** - Calculate clip boundaries based on animation progress

### Working Formula
```typescript
const progress = tween.progress(); // 0 to 1
const topShutterBottom = 50 - (progress * 50);  // 50vh → 0vh
const bottomShutterTop = 50 + (progress * 50);  // 50vh → 100vh
const clipPath = `polygon(
  0 0, 100% 0, 100% ${topShutterBottom}vh, 0 ${topShutterBottom}vh,
  0 ${bottomShutterTop}vh, 100% ${bottomShutterTop}vh, 100% 100%, 0 100%
)`;
```

### What Didn't Work
- ❌ Inset clip-path (too simple for this effect)
- ❌ Static clip-path values (doesn't sync with shutters)
- ❌ Opacity-based animations (user explicitly rejected)
- ❌ Changing z-index (violates core requirement)
- ❌ Percentage-based clip values (viewport height units work better)

### What Worked
- ✅ Polygon clip-path with 8 points
- ✅ Dynamic calculation via `onUpdate`
- ✅ Viewport height units (`vh`)
- ✅ Progress-based math
- ✅ Proper cleanup of tweens and ScrollTriggers
- ✅ Storing tween references instead of using context
