## Key Findings from Code Audit

### ✅ What's Actually Implemented

1. **NO ScrollSmoother** - Confirmed removed, using Lenis + standard ScrollTrigger
2. **Lenis Integration** - Properly initialized via `useLenis()` hook in App.tsx
3. **Consolidated Auth** - `src/contexts/auth.tsx` contains context, provider, and hook
4. **Environment Validation** - Zod validation in `src/lib/env.ts` with dev fallbacks
5. **51 shadcn/ui Components** - All installed and available
6. **ShutterOverlay** - Working with polygon clip-path animation (user modified since docs)
7. **Development-Friendly** - App works without env vars (shows placeholders)

### 🚧 What's Partially Done

1. **Database Migrations** - Files exist but are empty placeholders
2. **n8n Workflows** - 7 workflow JSON files defined but not connected
3. **Mapbox Integration** - Basic map working, conditional rendering based on token
4. **Stripe** - Configured but not integrated into flows

### ❌ What's Not Implemented

1. **Complete Ride Booking Flow** - UI exists, backend not connected
2. **Real-time Subscriptions** - Supabase configured, subscriptions not set up
3. **Partner Dashboard** - Placeholder page only
4. **WhatsApp Integration** - Workflows defined, not active
5. **Payment Processing** - Stripe configured, not integrated

## Breaking Changes

None - all updates are additive or clarifying existing documentation.

---

## Migration Notes

No migration needed - the reorganized structure is backward compatible. All documentation links have been updated.

## What's Next?

### Immediate Priorities (Based on Audit)
1. **Implement Database Schema** - Fill in empty migration files
2. **Complete Ride Booking Flow** - Connect UI to backend
3. **Set Up Real-time Subscriptions** - For ride tracking
4. **Activate n8n Workflows** - Connect WhatsApp notifications

### Documentation Priorities
1. Keep PROJECT_STATUS.md updated as features are completed
2. Document any new animation patterns discovered
3. Add troubleshooting guides as issues are solved
4. Create API documentation when backend routes are finalized

---

## Files for Review

Priority reading order for understanding the updates:

1. **README.md** - Start here for navigation
2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Understand current state
3. **MASTER_PROMPT.md** - Quick reference (updated)
4. **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Deep dive when making changes

## Animation Fix Documentation (October 18, 2025)

### Issue Resolved
**ShutterOverlay polygon clip-path animation** - Text now clips in perfect sync with shutter positions

### Solution Summary
- Switched from `inset()` to `polygon()` clip-path
- Used `onUpdate` callback for dynamic calculation
- Calculated polygon points based on animation progress
- Used viewport height units (`vh`) for perfect sync

### Documentation Added
1. **SHUTTER_OVERLAY_ANIMATION_ATTEMPTS.md** - Added Attempt 12 with complete solution
2. **docs/POLYGON-CLIPPATH-ANIMATION-GUIDE.md** - New comprehensive guide
3. **README.md** - Updated with new pattern references

### Key Learning
Polygon clip-path with dynamic calculation via `onUpdate` is the optimal approach for syncing complex reveal animations with scroll-based shutters. Viewport height units ensure perfect alignment regardless of screen size.
